paragraph
 BLAKE is a cryptographic hash function based on Dan Bernstein's ChaCha stream cipher, but a permuted copy of the input block, XORed with round constants, is added before each ChaCha round. Like SHA-2, there are two variants differing in the word size. ChaCha operates on a 4Ã—4 array of words. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
