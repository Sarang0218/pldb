paragraph
 LEXX is a text editor which was possibly the first to use live parsing and colour syntax highlighting. It was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM around 1985. The name was chosen because he wrote it as a tool for lexicographers, during an assignment for Oxford University Press's second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEXX_(text_editor)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
