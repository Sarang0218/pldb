paragraph
 The Berkeley Database (Berkeley DB) is an embedded database system that can be used in applications requiring high-performance concurrent storage and retrieval of key/value pairs. The software is distributed as a library that can be linked directly into an application. It provides a variety of programmatic interfaces, including callable APIs for C, C++, Perl, Tcl and Java. Users may download Berkeley DB from Sleepycat Softwareâ€™s Web site, at www.sleepycat.com.
