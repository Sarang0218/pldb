paragraph
 Alma-0 is a multi-paradigm computer programming language. This language is an augmented version of the imperative Modula-2 language with logic-programming features and convenient backtracking capability. It is small, strongly typed, and combines constraint programming, a limited number of features inspired by logic programming and supports imperative paradigms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma-0">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
