paragraph
 ThingLab is a visual programming environment implemented in Smalltalk and designed at Xerox PARC by Alan Borning. A conventional system allows a user to provide inputs that produce outputs.  A constraint-oriented system, such as ThingLab, allows the user to provide arbitrary inputs or outputs, then solves for whatever is unknown. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThingLab">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
