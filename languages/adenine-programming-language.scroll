 Haystack was a project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to research and develop several applications around personal information management and the Semantic Web. The most notable of those applications is the Haystack client, a research personal information manager (PIM) and one of the first to be based on semantic desktop technologies. The Haystack client is published as open source software under the BSD license. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
