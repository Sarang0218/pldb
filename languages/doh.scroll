paragraph
 DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution via the HTTPS protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks by using the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based DNS resolver.  Encryption by itself does not protect privacy, encryption is simply a method to obfuscate the data. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
