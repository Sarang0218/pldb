paragraph
 Chicken (stylized as CHICKEN) is a programming language, specifically a compiler and interpreter which implement a dialect of the programming language Scheme, and which compiles Scheme source code to standard C. It is mostly R5RS compliant and offers many extensions to the standard. The newer R7RS standard is supported through an extension library. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHICKEN_(Scheme_implementation)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
